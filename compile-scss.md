# SCSS Compilation Instructions

Since you have GitHub Actions set up for SCSS compilation, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Commit and push your changes
2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically compile SCSS to CSS

## Option 2: Install Sass locally
```bash
# Install Node.js first, then:
npm install -g sass

# Compile SCSS
sass styles/main.scss styles/main.css --style=compressed
```

## Option 3: Use VS Code Extension
Install "Live Sass Compiler" extension in VS Code for automatic compilation.
