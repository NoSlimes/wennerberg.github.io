  projectName: CAT SURVIVAL CRAFT [WORKING TITLE]
  projectType: "[PERSONAL PROJECT - NETWORKED GAMEPLAY]"
  flairs:
    - Unity
    - C#
    - Networking (NGO)
  overview: |
    An in-progress networked game project with server-authoritative gameplay. 
    So far it features a fully server-authoritative inventory system.
  projectInfo:
    Status: In Development
    Engine: Unity
    Language: C#
  contributions:
    - Implemented a secure, server-side inventory system to prevent cheating and item duplication.
    - Implemented a basic server-authoritative movement system with client-side prediction. 
  detailedSections:
    - heading: Networking Philosophy
      body: |
        The primary goal in this project is to build a secure, server-authoritative architecture. This means the server has the final say on all game state, preventing common cheats like flying or item duplication. 
        
        All player inputs are sent to the server, which processes them and broadcasts the resulting state back to the clients. All item useage (for tools like pickaxes, axes, etc.) is ran solely on the server, and the clients only receive the results of the actions. The game is made using NGO (Netcode for GameObjects).
        
        {{gallery:cat-survival-inventory-00.png,cat-survival-inventory-01.png|Inventory System Screenshots}}
    - heading: Networked Inventory System
      body: |
        The inventory system is built with server authority as the top priority. Every item operation—adding, removing, swapping, or transferring—is validated server-side to prevent cheating and duplication exploits. 
        
        The system elegantly handles both stackable items (like resources) and unique instanced items (like tools with durability), with configurable access rules enabling different gameplay scenarios like private player inventories or proximity-based chests.
        
        Built on Unity Netcode's RPC system, clients send action requests while the server maintains authority over all changes, ensuring fair gameplay with responsive UI updates.

  projectType: "[GAME PROJECT 3 - FUTUREGAMES]"
  flairs:
    - Unreal Engine 5
    - Blueprints
    - C++
    - Group Project
  overview: |
    Slaylien is a third-person wave-defense game where players control a team of three characters to fend off hordes of insectoid aliens. Developed in Unreal Engine 5, it features a unique character switching mechanic where players can switch between characters in real-time to utilize their unique abilities.
  projectInfo:
    Team Size: 11
    Engine: Unreal Engine 5
    Language: C++ & Blueprints
    Key Features: Wave Defense, Character Switching
  contributions:
    - Designed and implemented the real-time character switching system.
    - Developed the enemy AI using Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine 5.
    - Programmed core gameplay mechanics such as the health and stats systems.
    - Developed the data-driven wave spawning system
  detailedSections:
    - heading: The Character Switching Mechanic
      body: |
        The core design pillar was creating a dynamic combat experience. Instead of being locked into one playstyle, players can instantly swap between a tank, a damage-dealer, and a ranged character. This was implemented in C++, leveraging the possession system of the character/controllers in Unreal—when one character is unpossessed, the next gets posessed.
    - heading: AI Development
      body: |
        The alien AI was developed using Unreal's Behavior Trees and Blackboards. This allowed us to quickly prototype behaviours and easily adjust their parameters for balancing. When implenting the AI, I decided to aplit the characters, Units, in the game into two categories; Units that are controllable by the player, and Units that are solely controlled by the AI. This allowed us to create a more complex AI system, where the AI could control the alien units, while the player could control their own characters. When the player switches from a character, an AI controller kicks in, and takes control over the character, continuing to fight the aliens.
    - heading: Wave Defense Mechanics
      body: |
        The game features a wave-based system where players must survive increasingly difficult waves of enemies. The wave spawning system was designed to be data-driven, allowing designers to easily adjust enemy types, spawn rates, and wave difficulty without needing to modify code. When the game starts the wave manager reads the wave configuration file and spanws the wave based on it.

  overview: |
    Dead Sector is a top-down sci-fi shooter where the player must find their way off their alien-infested space ship. 
  projectInfo:
    Team Size: 16
    Engine: Unity
    Language: C#
  contributions:
    - Led the UI programming, creating all menus and in-game HUD elements.
    - Designed and implemented the quest system to guide player progression.
    - Contributed to general gameplay programming and bug-fixing.
  detailedSections:
    - heading: Modular UI System
      body: |
        I built a scalable UI system using C# and Unity's UGUI. It was managed by a MenuViewManager which handled switching between different menus and HUD states. This modular approach allowed for easy addition of new UI elements as the project evolved.
    - heading: Quest System Implementation
      body: |
        The quest system was designed to drive the game forward - it tracked player objectives and provided UI feedback. I implemented it using ScriptableObjects to define quests and a QuestManager to handle quest states and updates.

  projectName: SLIME MURDERER
  projectType: "[C# UNITY COURSE - FUTUREGAMES]"
  flairs:
    - Unity
    - C#
  overview: |
    During my first C# course at Futuregames, we were tasked with making a clone of the game "Vampire Survivors". The goal was to replicate the core gameplay loop of surviving endless waves of enemies with auto-attacking weapons and a robust power-up system.
  projectInfo:
    Team Size: 1
    Engine: Unity
    Language: C#
    Key Features: Endless | Abilities | Upgrades
  contributions:
    - Developed the entire game from scratch as a solo project in Unity.
    - Procedural enemy spawning and wave management
    - An extendable player ability and upgrade system
    - A custom status effect system
  detailedSections:
    - heading: Replicating the Core Loop
      body: |
        The biggest challenge was capturing the 'feel' of Vampire Survivors. Since I had never played the game before, I had to rely on gameplay videos and community feedback to understand its mechanics and pacing. I had to come up with my own interpretations of how certain systems worked, such as enemy spawn patterns and weapon behaviors. I opted to focus on active abilities rather than many passive ones to create a more engaging gameplay experience.
    - heading: Custom Status Effects
      body: |
        I implemented a custom status effect system that supports various effects like burning and poison. This system uses inheritance, allowing a specific status effect class to be selected in the inspector for abilities, where its settings can also be adjusted.
    - heading: Performance Optimization
      body: |
        With hundreds of enemies and projectiles on screen, performance was crucial. I implemented a comprehensive object pooling system to avoid constant instantiation and destruction of GameObjects. This system uses a centralized manager with utility methods for easy spawning and includes proper cleanup mechanisms.

  overview: |
    A 2.5D two player side scroller in Unreal Engine 5 where players control 2 characters tethered together. I primarily worked on the tether mechanic and player movement.
  projectInfo:

  contributions:
    - Developed the tether mechanic to allow for unique cooperative gameplay.
    - Implemented player movement and controls.
  detailedSections:
    - heading: Tether Mechanic
      body: |
        The tether mechanic was a core feature that attached the two players together. It allowed for unique cooperative gameplay, as players had to work together to navigate the environment and get over obstacles .
    - heading: Player Movement
      body: |
        I implemented the player movement system, implementing movement and wall- and double-jumping mechanics.
