Dead Sector is a top-down sci-fi shooter where the player must find their way off their alien-infested space ship.


## Modular UI System

I built a scalable UI system using C# and Unity's UGUI. It was managed by a MenuViewManager which handled switching between different menus and HUD states. This modular approach allowed for easy addition of new UI elements as the project evolved.

## Quest System Implementation

The quest system was designed to drive the game forward - it tracked player objectives and provided UI feedback. I implemented it using ScriptableObjects to define quests and a QuestManager to handle quest states and updates.
