A 2.5D two player side scroller in Unreal Engine 5 where players control 2 characters tethered together. I primarily worked on the tether mechanic and player movement.


## Tether Mechanic

The tether mechanic was a core feature that attached the two players together. It allowed for unique cooperative gameplay, as players had to work together to navigate the environment and get over obstacles .

## Player Movement

I implemented the player movement system, implementing movement and wall- and double-jumping mechanics.
