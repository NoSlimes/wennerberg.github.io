              <p class="text-large">
                Hey there! I'm Elias, a 21-year-old game development student from Sweden currently diving deep into programming at Futuregames. 
                What started as early experiments with code has led me here, still figuring things out but loving the process.
              </p>
              <p>
                I grew up in a small Swedish village and started programming in my early teens, 
                gave up for a while... then picked it back up a few years later and haven't been able to put it down since. Just being able to make something digital and see it work is really nice! 
                I'm always going back to old projects months later, looking at my previous code and thinking "what was I doing here?" ‚Äì then spending hours improving and iterating on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently my interest in making networked multiplayer games has really grown. I've always liked writing abstract and reusable code ‚Äì making things modular and flexible ‚Äì and for some dumb reason also enjoy wrestling with networking. 
                There's something satisfying about getting different systems to talk to each other properly.
