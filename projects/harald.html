                    Harald is a game that I've been working on from now and then for over 2 years at this point (2023). I'm
                    currently working on Harald together with my girlfriend as a commission for the LBS Game Awards that's
                    hosted by my school.

                    Harald is a horror game set deep in the Swedish woods. You, a normal civilian, find yourself stranded in this
                    strange forest as you suddenly crash your car. You look around and see that there's a trail with lights a bit ahead of you.
                    What happens if you follow the road is up for you to tell.

                    Since my girlfriend and I picked up the game again, we've been working on improving the game in pretty much
                    all ways. We've made new level designs for both outdoor and indoor scenes. The original plan was just to have an interior,
                    but I added an exterior when I worked on the game during 2022, and we've kept that idea. We also decided to switch over to
                    Unity's HD Render Pipeline, as it will make it easier for us to get the game looking the way we want. It allows for much
                    better control over lighting right out of the box, with dynamic skies and volumetric clouds and fog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I started working on the game in 2020, I've become much better at both programming and using the tools
                    provided by Unity. When we started working on it for the LBS Game Awards, I realized how much of the game I
                    would have to rewrite to be able to use it efficiently. Safe to say, the code was a mess, and I've been
                    working on making it more modular and easier to read.

                    Other than the technical stuff, I've also been working on improving the overall visuals. The trees I made
                    in 2022 have been remade, with a much smaller poly count and a much better-looking result. I watched one of
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mediagabbitt">Grant Abbit's</a> tutorials on how to make low-poly,
                    fairly realistic trees in Blender and took some inspiration from that. The main problem I had before was the leaves,
                    but I found out about leaf planes/leaf plates, which made the whole process much easier with fewer vertices.
