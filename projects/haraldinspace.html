        <p>Harald In Space is one of my Unity game projects that are currently on hold. In the game, a group of 1-4
            players are set on a space station and are to peform
            an mission together. They must sneak their way through the level and avoid getting caught in their mission.
            The game has a simplistic low-poly style but still has personality.

            You can download the latest build of the game <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/z3cs4fst445f6w7/HaraldInSpace-Build.zip?dl=1">here</a> if you want to. Don't know if you will be
            able to other players though. If you wanna try anyway, don't forget to port-forward as the steam-join
            doesn't work 95% of the time.

            We also made a spotify playlist to set the musical feel of the game.
