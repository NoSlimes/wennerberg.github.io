        <p>HexGame is a small test project I made when I wanted to make a simple strategy game. The game consists of a
            map made up of hexagons, hence the name of the game. It would have been a pretty basic game. The player
            would be able to select tiles to place objects on. Different objects would have different costs and
            different effects. There would also be some tiles that would have "occult" buildings on them, these
            buidlings would have some effects that would either be beneficial or give the player an disadvantage. I hope
            to continue working on the game in the future when I've got more time to work on my projects.

            Currently, I've got no build of this game up to download.
