        <p>NoSlimes Random Crap is an old minecraft mod I made a year or so ago. It's the result of me just messing
            around in MCreator and adding a bunch of random items, hence the name. I somehow managed to get the mod
            accepted on CurseForge and if you want you can download it there. I only ever released it in minecraft
            1.16.5, so it's a little bit old. Maybe I'll port it in the future if I have the time. Maybe I'll rewrite it
            completely in Java. Only time will tell.

            You can download it <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/noslimes-random-crap">here</a>.
