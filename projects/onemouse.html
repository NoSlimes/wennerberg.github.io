        <p>OneMouse is a game we made in or class "Digitalt Skapande 2", in english something in the lines of "Digital
            creating 2". The goal of the game is to navigate a maze, while you are being hunted by a a "big fat
            dammr√•tta". It's set under a bed, which makes the maze of legoes and other stuff more difficult to navigate.
            As I'm studying game graphics I wasn't supposed to do much programming for this game. I did some anyway
            since the programmers in the group needed assistance with a lot of stuff.
