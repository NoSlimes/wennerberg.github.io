        <p>This is a simulated rube goldberg machine I made for animation class in the fall of 2021, when I was just
            beginning to
            use 3D-modelling software. I'm fine with the result bu I definietly could have done it better today, proving
            that I've actually developed since I've started. Also, I might made it just slightly more advanced than the
            class requested. Like.. I completely rendered it and everything.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here's a video of it.
