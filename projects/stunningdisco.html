        <p>Stunning Disco is a game project we made as a group project durin "Digitalt Skapande 2", "digital creating 2"
            class. In the game 2 players control characters and compete against each other in finishing key
            combinations. It's a little bit similar to Friday Night Funkin'. If we'd gotten that far, the player who was
            in the lead would have pushed the crowd surrounding the platforms the players were standing on more towards
            the other player, eventually throwing them off their platform.</p>
