        <p>This is an old Tetris copy I made in my first year of High School, or whatever the equivalent of the swedish
            "Gymnasium" is, when I was 16 years old. I think I was the only one in the class that had even touched Unity
            or C# before, even though I studied game programming that year. Safe to say, I was the best at it in the
            entire class. Even our teacher had barely even touched Unity before by the looks of it.
